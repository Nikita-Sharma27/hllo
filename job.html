                    <h5>Last Updated, June 17, 2021</h5>
                    <div> <img src="The-top-5-cyber-security-jobs-with-growing-demand-in-India.jpg" class="topimg justify-align-center  img-fluid mx-auto d-block">
                    </div>
                    <p>While other types of IT jobs like network administrators or software developers are more common and well-known, cyber security jobs are smaller in number but fast increasing in importance. As our global economy has led to more Internet-based
                        computing and connectivity the world over, organizations have grown ever more vulnerable to hacking and cyber-attacks. And just as a business might hire security even when there’s a local police force, so must a business hire cyber
                        security staff. It is ultimately the duty of the organization to protect their proprietary data as well as any customer information they are privy to.
                    </p>
                    <p> These cyber security professionals are in short supply, however. Last year, NASSCOM reported that India alone would need 1 million cyber security professionals by 2020, while job portal Indeed reported a spike of 150 percent in cyber
                        security roles between January 2017 and March 2018. Companies like KPMG have doubled the size of their cyber security teams in recent years.</p>

                    <h2 class="factors">Factors rising the need of Cyber Security</h2>
                    <h5>Last Updated, June 17, 2021</h5>
                    <div> <img src="factors.png" class="topimg justify-align-center  img-fluid mx-auto d-block"></div>
                    <p>The recent overwhelming need for cyber security is the result of several factors:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h4> Digital India and Demonetization</h4>
                                <p>According to Ashok Pamidi, the senior director of NASSCOM, while the government’s initiatives such as Digital India and demonetization have pushed companies towards digital transformation, doing so has also made them vulnerable
                                    to cyber-attacks. In turn, this has led to a demand for cyber security professionals who can help companies achieve digital transformation without compromising security.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h4> General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) </h4>
                                <p>Although the GDPR didn’t go into effect until late in May 2018, companies across the world have been preparing to safeguard their database from cyber crimes and comply with GDPR rules. This has driven a need for cyber security
                                    experts.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <h4> Aftermath of WannaCry Ransomware </h4>
                                <p>A year ago, in May 2017, government agencies and organizations across the world fell prey to the WannaCry ransomware, which infected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries within just three days. According to the latest
                                    numbers, it led to damage estimated up to hundreds of billions of dollars! The attack launched a debate on the vulnerability of data and the pressing need for stronger cyber laws and security systems. It has also caused
                                    many organizations to be more aware of the perils of cyber security loopholes and take steps to safeguard their organization from future attacks.</p>

                                <p>The network security engineer is a critical position within every organization. This person ensures the security systems are implemented within the organization to counter and stop threats. Their main responsibilities include
                                    maintaining systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and improving automation. They also oversee the maintenance of firewalls, routers, switches, various network monitoring tools, and VPNs (virtual private networks).</p>

                                <h4>Cyber Security Analyst</h4>
                                <p>A cyber security analyst helps in planning, implementing, and upgrading security measures and controls. They continuously monitor security access and perform internal and external security audits to ensure there are no
                                    loopholes or evidence of security lapses. A cyber security analyst is also responsible for conducting vulnerability testing, risk analyses, and security assessments, and for managing the network. In addition to these
                                    tasks, the analyst trains fellow employees in security awareness and procedures, so they are aware of the best practices to be followed to avoid security breaches.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p>The salary of a cyber security analyst begins at Rs 6 lakhs per annum.</p>

                            <p>A security architect plays a crucial role in designing the network and computer security architecture for their company. The security architect helps in planning, researching and designing elements of security. Without a security
                                architect, a company’s security system is vulnerable to attacks. The security architect first creates a design based on the needs of the company and then works together with the programming team to build the final structure.
                                Besides building the architecture, they also develop company policies and procedures for how their company's employees should use the security systems and decide on the punitive action in case of lapses. </p>
                            <p>The average pay of a security architect begins at Rs 17 lakhs per annum.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Cyber Security Manager</h4>
                            <p>Cyber security managers are responsible for the maintenance of security protocols throughout the organization. They create strategies to increase network and Internet security related to different projects and manage a team
                                of IT professionals to ensure the highest standards of data security. A cyber security manager also frequently reviews the existing security policies and ensures the policies are currently based on new threats. They also
                                perform regular checks on all servers, switches, routers and other connected devices to make sure there are no loopholes in the security.</p>
                            <p>The average salary of a cyber security manager begins at Rs 12 lakhs per annum.</p>
                        </li>

                                interruption to the business. They are also responsible for overseeing the implementation of security policies and procedures within the organization.</p>
                            <p>The average salary for top CISOs is anywhere between Rs 2 crores to 4 crores.</p>
