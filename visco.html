            <h1>The logical choice for cyber security.</h1>
            <p>
            </p> The Ensuring the security of confidential business data including your customer’s sensitive personal and financial details requires constant attention. And though not every business demands the full-time commitment of an executive to oversee
            this function, small- to mid-sized businesses do need the same level of security and intelligence already in place at larger corporations. That’s where we step in. We can protect your organization at the same level you would expect from a
            full-time chief information security officer through our Virtual CISO service without the steep investment of executive compensation and their associated benefits package. Work in collaboration with an advanced vCISO professional able to maintain
            a relationship with your team and become familiar with both your environment and industry so you stay on top of constantly evolving threats and regulations. See More Information on our CISO Services Brochure</p>
            <h1>What is a Virtual CISO? </h1><br>
            <p> A virtual chief information security officer, or vCISO, is a professional who works routinely with organizations to provide all of the essential cyber security support one would expect from an in-house senior executive within a more efficient
                and affordable service model. Gain day-to-day cyber security support and counsel from a dedicated vCISO along with long-term security strategy, vision, program and policy design, and implementation. vCISOs conduct a comprehensive assessment
                of a company’s security posture to pinpoint weaknesses and optimize their security standing over the long-term. Acting either as a long-standing resource for your team or as interim CISO, a vCISO will step in to establish security standards,
                implement controls, and respond rapidly to incidents—continually refining your approach to address the dynamic threat landscape along with industry best practices and regulations. Why us? While it’s not always cost effective to hire a
                full-time Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to lead risk management and information assurance programs, our advisors can deliver much of the same services at a fraction of the investment you would pay for a full-time executive
                hire. Reduce your risk profile with hands-on vCISO support from a dedicated advisor who already understands the small business environment. We’re entrepreneurial, wear multiple hats like you do, and can protect your organization with the
                right strategic and operational vision. Team up with a proactive, self-driven virtual CISO—delivering the adaptability you need to meet the demands of external influences such as customer requests, audit requirements, and rising threats.
                Virtual CISO Service Benefits Transform your security profile under our convenient and cost-efficient vCISO support model that integrates seamlessly as an extension to your team. And while the substantial cost reduction in the virtual
                CISO model is most attractive, vCISO benefits are even further reaching to provide a distinct advantage over both executive hire and collaboration with a solo security consultant. Choosing Cyber Security Services’ vCISO plan delivers the
                strength in our combined team knowledge paired with the personal attention of a dedicated vCISO who brings experience in your industry. And beyond that industry expertise, we offer executive-level strategy, security planning, annual risk
                assessments, and the scalability you need to ebb and flow with changing business demands. Trust our vCISO services to deliver the insight and benchmarking only attainable from a company that works confidentially alongside others in your
                industry along with leading, established corporations. How can a Virtual CISO assist your organization? A vCISO is your security point-of-contact for all security related issues, offering a direct line to experts as questions naturally
                arise. A virtual CISO will also respond to incidents, answer security-related questionnaires for your customers, and respond to data breach should that arise. In addition to ongoing and ad hoc support, a vCISO will tie into meetings when
                security expertise and guidance are needed. Additional vCISO support includes:
